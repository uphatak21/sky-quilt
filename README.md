# sky-quilt

**Welcome to sky quilt.** sky quilt is an app where the user is prompted to upload a picture of their sunset every day, making a big “quilt” of images over time. I hope to encourage users to notice the sky each day, and thus to remember the small moments from each day. In addition to the many difficult things that are constantly happening in the world (death, war, climate change), one of those many constants is the sunset. I think that is something worth remembering.
